# Coursera-Financial-Aid

1.Why are you applying for Financial Aid? (150 words minimum required)

Ans: I’m a student from India and want to learn Web Development. Am currently purusing my Engineering in Computer Science but I’ve no job of my own to carry the expenses to pay for the certificate of this course. I live only for my scholarship, it is very difficult for me to gather such amount of money for the certificate. Financial Aid will help me take this course without any adverse impact on my monthly essential needs. So I’m badly in need of this financial aid. I want to take this course as I want to learn and grow my carrier in this field. This course will boost my job prospects after graduation from my institute. It will help perform better in understanding and learning this technology and give me an edge over my competitors. A verified certificate will attach credibility to the certificate I receive from this course. I plan to complete all assignments on or before time as I have done in previous Signature Track Courses. Also, I intend to participate in Discussion Forums, which I have found to supplement my learning immensely in the other online courses I have taken on Coursera. I also plan to grade assignments that are to peer-reviewed which I believe will an invaluable learning opportunity.It also adds weightage on my resume.
